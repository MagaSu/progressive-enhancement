    <blockquote class="content-text">
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</br>
      That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</br>
    </br>
      They said: <em>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
      This is most unfortunate.”</em> </br>The farmer said: <em>“Maybe.”</em>
    </br>
    </br>
      The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,</br>
      and in the evening everybody came back and said:
      <em>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em></br>
      The farmer again said: <em>“Maybe.”</em></br>
    </br>
      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses,
      and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    </br>
      The neighbors then said: <em>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em>
    </br>
      and the farmer responded: <em>“Maybe.”</em></br>
    </br>
      The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
      and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
    </br>
      Again all the neighbors came around and said: <em>“Isn’t that great!”</em> </br>Again, he said: <em>“Maybe.”</em>

      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
      and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — 
      because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
      or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</br>

        Good and Bad are just one perspective.
        Bananas are good for monkeys,
        but monkeys are not good for bananas.
        Let's make a big deal out of it...
